# WebOfThings

This section is a reference implementation of the NEgotiation process.
The operations supported are add, update and delete.

- Producer.js and client.js contain sample examples to perform these operations. 
- td.json is the Servient TD
- td_thing.json is the Thing TD.

Currently, the operations are only written for HTTP but can be extended to MQTT and Kafka.
